# Weather-App

The Weather app uses the DarkSKy API to get its data using javascript and presents them into a simple and functional interface made using HTML and CSS. The app is complete with a short desciption of the current weather with an accompanying animated icon from skycons. The app also uses gps to give you the weather for your location and the temperature in both celsius and farenheit.
